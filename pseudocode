Flow of game in project 4

Game will now be in a tournament style:

-Welcome the user to the game
-Explain how the game will work
/*****************
 *FIGHTER SEQUENCE
 *****************/
-Ask them how many players each time will have in the tournament
	- Make sure that they input something larger than 0, and less than 20.
-Loop through X amount of times(however many the user chose)
	-Ask them if they want to rename each fighter
	-From there ask the user to choose their primary member
		-If they chose to rename each character, then prompt for renaming
	-Then let them add each additional character afterwards
		-If they chose to rename each character, then prompt for renaming
-Ask the user if they would like to pick the enemy team, or randomize it
	-If yes on choice, do the prior looping again.
	-Else, automatically roll a number and assign that individual to the team.

**** The teams will be created in a Queue format, this would allow for use to easily loop during the battle ****

/*****************
 *BATTLE SEQUENCE
 *****************/
-Begin the match by fighting both primaries against eachother.
-The winner will stay in their teams queue, gaining back (ranom roll) percent of their health
	-The winning team will earn +2 points towards their wins
-The loser will be removed and placed into a losers bin.
	-The losing team will lose 1 point in their wins.
-If somehow there is a tie, (which I don't believe can occur in my implementation)
	-Both teams will obtain +1 wins.
-The fighting will continue to loop until one team has 0 members remaining.

/*****************
 *RESULTS SEQUENCE
 *****************/
-Display the results:
	-Team 1 Points:
	-Team 2 Points:

	-Team 1 # of members lost:
	-Team 2 # of members lost:

	-Congratulations Team X on the tournament victory!

-Ask the user if they would like to play again.
